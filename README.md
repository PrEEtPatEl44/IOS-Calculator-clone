<b><h1>iOS Calculator Clone App</h1></b>
This project is an iOS calculator clone app developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The app provides basic calculator functionality, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. However, there are two known bugs that need attention:

<b><h2>Bugs</h2></b>
The +/- button, intended for changing the sign of a given number, is currently not functioning as expected.

The clear button is clearing the entire input rather than removing the last entered digit.

<b><h2>Features</h2></b>
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Keyboard Support: The app is designed to work seamlessly with both mouse input and keyboard input. You can use the keyboard for numeric input and basic arithmetic operations.
